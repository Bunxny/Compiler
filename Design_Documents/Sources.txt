follow specific links e.g. 'function' to see examples of std::function at http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function


According to a reply to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13795679/map-fold-operators-in-c by Jerry Coffin,
there are C++ STL functions that are similar to map and fold/reduce:

      At least if my memory for the terminology serves correctly,
      map is essentially std::transform, and fold is std::accumulate.

Then see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/transform and http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/accumulate.
