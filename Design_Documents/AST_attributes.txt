This file describes the attributes defined on the AST, roughly in the
order they would be defined.

* my_reg (defined only for expresisons) is the HERA register into
  which the expression's result will be placed.

  Note that my_reg will only be computed once and then stored, so
  calling my_reg() a whole bunch won't actually have much cost.


* HERA_code (defined for all node types) is the HERA machine language
  equivalent of the node (including its children).

  Each time HERA_code() is called, it will traverse the tree.
  It is meant to be called *once*, at the root, and not more.
